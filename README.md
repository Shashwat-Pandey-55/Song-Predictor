This is a project which involves Machine Learning concepts. First step of making ML projects is to import data
from various .csv files. These files may contain databases with lots of data. Then we clean our data and separate
the data into two segments. One for our training model, and other for testing it to make sure model produces right 
result. This project is based on the library side kick learn. Python library used in this project is numpy which
provides multidimensional array. Another library is Pandas which is a data analysis library that provides a frame 
called data frame. Data frame is an 2D data structure similar to a spreadsheet. Another library used is MatPlotLib
which is a 2 dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots. Sidekick learn library provides all famous 
algorithms like decision trees, neural networks etc. I used jupiter environment to write the code as vs code is not 
ideal for ML projects.
